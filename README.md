The above flowchart illustrates the working of the financial fraud prevention system. It outlines the steps involved in detecting and preventing phishing attacks.

## Random Forest Model

### Model Architecture

The Random Forest model is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

### Training and Testing

The Random Forest model was trained on a dataset containing labeled examples of phishing and legitimate websites. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Web Crawler:

Our website also uses a web crawler to identify the malicious websites all over the internet and it also displays lists of malicious websites which may be malicious on the Website

The Website uses the following technologies:
### Node.js
### Mongodb
### React.js

## Usage

1. Users can enter a URL in the provided input field.
2. Click on the "Check" button.
3. The system will return a result indicating whether the website is likely to be a phishing site or not.
